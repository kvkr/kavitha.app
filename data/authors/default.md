Dear Reader,

I'm Kavitha Krishnappa, Analyst turned UX Researcher.
With 5+ yrs of work experience, I use stories(mostly :P) & numbers to make a case for better user experience.
A strong advocate for user-centered approach, I strive to bring a disciplined mixed methods approach to get closer to the truth through effective collaboration.

Besides UX, you may also find me sketching portraits, learning new languages, or travelling.

If this sounds interesting to you, let's chat :)
