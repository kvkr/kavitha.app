Dear reader,

I'm Kavitha Krishnappa, Analyst turned UX Researcher.
With 5+ yrs of work experience, I use stories(mostly :P) & numbers to make a case for better user experience.
A strong advocate for user-centered approach, I strive to bring a disciplined mixed methods approach to get closer to the truth through effective collaboration.

When I am not working, I am either sketching portraits or learning a new language, or traveling.

If this sounds interesting to you, let's chat :)
