## System Thinking, UX Research, UI/UX

The prompt for this project was my volunteer experience for on-going public strike against the flyover that would demolish so many trees in the city.  After some initial conversations with few activists, I chose to work on this topic of urban governance for a studio course to apply system thinking principles to design.
